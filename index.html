                <p>The BMW M8 is the high performance version of the BMW 8 Series (G15) marketed under the BMW M sub-brand. Released in June 2019, the M8 was initially produced in the 2-door convertible (F91 model code) and 2-door coupe (F92 model code)
                    body styles. A 4-door fastback sedan (F93 model code, marketed as 'Gran Coupe') body style was added to the lineup in October 2019. The M8 is powered by the BMW S63 twin-turbocharged V8 engine shared with the BMW M5 (F90). BMW revived
                    the 8 Series nameplate by introducing the M8 GTE, which replaced the M6 GTLM at the end of the 2017 season of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, leading to speculation about a production equivalent to the racing car.<br>                    At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, BMW introduced the M8 Gran Coupé Concept, which previewed a high performance four-door variant of the Concept 8 Series introduced alongside the M8 GTE at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. The design of the
                    concept was based on the M8 GTE and sported aggressive M performance visual parts.Prototypes of the M8 began testing in June 2017 when another Concept of the 8 Series was unveiled to the public.

                    The M8 is based on the BMW CLAR platform ,with MacPherson strut suspension at the front and multi-link suspension at the rear. Adaptive dampers are standard equipment. The all-wheel-drive system (called xDrive) has the ability to decouple its front axle
                    to make the car purely rear-wheel-drive, a feature first introduced on the M5. The M8 is powered by a version of the BMW S63 twin-turbocharged V8 engine which is shared with the M5, X5M and X6M models.This engine is rated at 441 kW
                    (591 hp) at 6,000 rpm and 750 N⋅m (553 lb⋅ft) in the standard M8 model, with peak power increasing to 460 kW (617 hp) at 6,000 rpm, while torque remains the same for the M8 Competition model.The sole transmission available for the
                    M8 is an 8-speed torque converter ZF 8HP76 automatic transmission manufactured by ZF Friedrichshafen called the "M-Steptronic" by BMW and also shared with the F90 M5.The standard brakes consist of iron discs, with carbon ceramic brakes
                    being optional. The level of power assist for the brakes can be set to either ‘comfort’ or ‘sport’ mode using the iDrive controller, a feature which has been criticised for resulting in inconsistent brake pedal feel. The "M8 Competition"
